# Challenge Project: Flashcards

This project was developed as a component of Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Course. It is divided into three main sections: the first allows you to create topics for your quizzes; the second lets you view the quizzes; and the third enables you to create the quizzes themselves. Data management is handled through a Redux store.

## Technology 

1. React
